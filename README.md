# Halo: Combat Evolved for Android

This project is a port of the Halo: Combat Evolved decompilation to Linux,
Windows and Android. The decompilation is of the Xbox build 2342
(`cachebeta.exe`, SHA-256
`4cc87b45f721270392a96f1674ed2b5cd4a7bb4355faeab4531d1cf1884d9520`).

The port starts from the decompilation of [bnunu/halo-1](https://github.com/bnunu/halo-1).
That project is a fork of [punpckhdq/halo](https://github.com/punpckhdq/halo).

The game updates itself. At start-up it looks for a newer release, and asks
if you want to install it. Refer to "Updates" in
[port/linux/README.md](port/linux/README.md#updates).

Each build of the `main` branch that passes on all three platforms is a new
release. The [Releases](https://github.com/cybersecurity/halo-ce-universal/releases)
page keeps the last five releases. If the latest build has a problem, get
an older build from that page.

## Game data

The port does not include the game data. Download an Xbox disc image
(`.xiso` or `.iso`) of Halo: Combat Evolved. All versions of the game
operate. The maps of the European (PAL) version were made for a slower
console. The port changes them to play as the North American (NTSC) maps do,
so players of the two versions can play together.

1. Start the game.
2. At the first start, the game asks for the disc image. Select it.
3. The game extracts the `maps/` folder. Then the game starts.

On Linux and Windows, the game puts `maps/` next to the executable. On
Android, copy the disc image to the phone first. The app puts `maps/` in its
data folder. Refer to [port/android/README.md](port/android/README.md).

## Platforms

Each platform has its own instructions:

| Platform | Instructions |
| --- | --- |
| Linux (32-bit x86 executable, OpenGL 4.5, SDL3) | [port/linux/README.md](port/linux/README.md) |
| Windows (32-bit x86 executable, OpenGL 4.5, SDL3) | [port/windows/README.md](port/windows/README.md) |
| Android (arm64 app, OpenGL ES 3, SDL3) | [port/android/README.md](port/android/README.md) |

The Linux README also gives the controls, the settings and the multiplayer
functions. These are almost the same on all platforms.

## Multiplayer

The game can play system link games on a local network and on the internet:

- A system link game can have up to 128 players on up to 128 machines.
- Linux, Windows and Android machines can play in the same game.
- An invite link lets a machine join a game on the internet. No server of
  this project is necessary.
- The netcode is new. Each machine moves its own player at once,
  and the host makes the decisions for the game. Refer to
  [port/linux/NETCODE.md](port/linux/NETCODE.md).
